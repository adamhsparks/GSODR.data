# GSODRdata: Climate Data for the GSODR Package

 This data-only package was created for distributing data useful for the GSODR
 package and illustrated in examples given in the GSODR documentation. Four data
 frames are provided by this package. The first three fields are identical in
 all four dataframes and allow for linking with data generated by the 
 [GSODR](https://github.com/adamhsparks/GSODR) package,  
 
  * STNID, a unique code assigned to GSOD stations generated by the GSODR package  
  * LON, Longitude in WGS84 system  
  * LAT, Latitude in WGS84 system.  

For an example of the usage of these data, see the vignette, [Working with spatial and climate data](http://adamhsparks.github.io/GSODR/articles/Working_with_spatial_and_climate_data.html).

## CHELSA

[Climatic surfaces at 1 km resolution](http://chelsa-climate.org)

CHELSA data is based on a quasi-mechanistic statistical downscaling of the ERA interim global circulation model (Karger et al. 2016). ESA's CCI-LC cloud probability monthly averages are based on the MODIS snow products (MOD10A2).

## CRU

[CRU CL 2.0 data-set](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/~timm/grid/CRU_CL_2_0.html)

The CRU CL 2.0 data set (New et al. 2002) comprises monthly grids of observed mean climate from 1961-1990, and covering the global land surface at a 10 minute spatial resolution. There are eight climatic variables available, and also the elevations on the grid: diurnal temperature range, precipitation, mean temperature, wet-day frequency, frost-day frequency, relative humidity, sunshine, and wind-speed. In addition minimum and maximum temperature may be deduced from mean temperature and diurnal temperature range (see [FAQ](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/~timm/grid/faq.html)).
